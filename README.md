# Roblox Anti-AFK
> An ahk script for bypassing the afk-kick in roblox.

This is an autohotkey program for stopping roblox from automatically kicking you from the game after 20 minutes. This is not a script for use in any cheat, it's an autohotkey script.

The script is very easy to use, and can be operated by the graphical user-interface that pops up when you run it.

## How to set-up
> This part will tell you how to install / setup the script.

The only requirement this script has is having the version 2 of autohotkey. If you do not have this version of autohotkey it can be easily installed from the official website.

The link for the official website is below.

Make sure to press `Download`, and then press `Download v2.0`. Thats all you need to do in order to use this script. See the how to use below.

## How to use
> This part will tell you how to use the script.

In order to use the script, simply download the file from this github page. Once you've got the script, double click it to open the gui.

The gui will look exactly like below, so take a good look at it either on your own computer or on the screenshot to see how it works.

To toggle the anti-afk, simply hit enable, and make sure your roblox window is focused. If the window is not focused the anti-afk will not stop you from being kicked.

The exit keybind is `CTRL + ALT + F1`, this will exit the script immediately if you have struggle closing it. Only use this if it's needed, as it won't stop the script, it will close the entire thing.

For the process name, do not touch this unless your roblox window has a different title. If it does enter that title into the box exactly how it shows up, because its CaSe sEnSiTiVe.

That's everything about the script, thanks so much for using it if you do!
